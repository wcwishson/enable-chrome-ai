# Enable Chrome AI ✨

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Enable Gemini in Chrome, AI Powered History search, and DevTools AI Innovations in Google Chrome—without cleaning data or reinstalling.

Tiny Python helper that enables Chrome's built-in AI features by patching your local profile data (`variations_country`, `variations_permanent_consistency_country`, and `is_glic_eligible`)—no browser flags required.

## ✅ Requirements
- Python `3.13+` (see `.python-version` / `pyproject.toml`)
- Google Chrome installed (Stable/Canary/Dev/Beta)

## ⚡️ Quick Start (uv)
1. Install uv (once, PowerShell): `irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex` (see uv docs for other shells).
2. Install deps (creates venv automatically): `uv sync`.
3. Run the script: `uv run main.py`.
4. Chrome will close while patching; after it restarts, press Enter to finish.

## ⚡️ Quick Start (pip)
1. Create and activate a venv.
2. Install deps: `python -m pip install psutil`.
3. Run: `python main.py`.

## 🔧 What Happens
- Finds Chrome user data for Stable/Canary/Dev/Beta on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Kills top-level Chrome processes to avoid file locks, then brings them back.
- Sets all `is_glic_eligible` to `true` in `Local State` (recursive search).
- Sets `variations_country` to `"us"` in `Local State`.
- Sets `variations_permanent_consistency_country` to `["<version>", "us"]` in `Local State`.
- Restarts any Chrome builds that were running before the patch.

## ⚠️ Caveats / Known Limitations
- The script expects `User Data/Local State` to exist; if it's missing, the run can fail (launch Chrome once to generate it).
- Chrome restart only happens if the executable path can be detected from running processes.
- On macOS, process detection is name-based (`Google Chrome*`) and may terminate more than just the "top-level" app process.
- On Linux, process detection expects an executable name of `chrome`; if your build uses a different name, Chrome may not be closed (and files may remain locked).

## 🛟 Notes
- The script writes to your existing Chrome profile; back up `User Data` if you want a safety net.
- Run as the same OS user who owns the Chrome profile to ensure write access.
- Not affiliated with Google—use at your own risk.
